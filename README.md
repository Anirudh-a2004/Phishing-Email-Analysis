Identifying the phishing characteristics  in a suspicious email

Phishing Email Analysis Report

Objective:
The objective of this task was to identify potential phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

Common Analysis Summary:
The suspicious email was examined for typical phishing indicators such as:

Suspicious Sender Address: The sender's email domain did not match the official organization’s domain.
Greeting: The email used terms like “Dear user” or “Dear customer” instead of the recipient’s actual name.
Urgent or Threatening Language: The message pressured the recipient to act quickly (e.g., “Your account will be suspended if not verified immediately”).
Suspicious Links or Attachments: Embedded links redirected to unofficial websites, and attachments had unusual file extensions.
Poor Grammar and Spelling: Multiple grammatical errors indicated it might not be from a professional organization.
Header Analysis Findings: The header analysis revealed mismatched “Received From” IP locations and failed SPF/DKIM authentication checks, confirming the sender’s identity was spoofed.

Key findings in the email are:

In this LinkedIn scam,
The user’s name isn’t specified in the greeting, which means it’s likely sent to multiple email addresses in bulk. 
The business name is in all capital letters throughout the email, which is not their trademark or branding. 
There are multiple grammar issues, which is uncommon for a reputable organization. 
LinkedIn will also never ask you for your password via email.
